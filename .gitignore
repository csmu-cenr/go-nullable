# The .DS_Store file is a file created by macOS Finder to store custom attributes of a folder. It stands for "Desktop Services Store." These files are hidden by default in macOS, and their primary purpose is to store metadata about the visual layout of a folder, such as the position of icons, view options, and custom background images.
